            <p>The United States and its partners continue to face a 
growing number of global threats and challenges. The CIA&#8217;s mission 
includes collecting and analyzing information about high priority 
national security issues such as international terrorism, the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, cyber attacks, 
international organized crime and narcotics trafficking, regional 
conflicts, counterintelligence threats, and the effects of environmental
 and natural disasters.</p>
<p>These challenges are international in scope and are priorities for 
the Central Intelligence Agency. If you have information about these or 
other national security challenges, please provide it through our secure
 online form.  The information you provide will be protected and 
confidential. The CIA is particularly interested in information about 
imminent or planned terrorist attacks.  In cases where an imminent 
threat exists, immediately contact your local law enforcement agencies 
and provide them with the threat information.</p>
